# Sign Language Interpretation System

## Introduction
This Sign Language Interpretation System is a class project for CSC 450 under Dr. Razib Iqbal at Missouri State University.

The sign language interpretation system will take a video stream input from an integrated camera and interpret hand gestures into pre-defined commands. It will recognize the gestures with high accuracy in real time. The system will be tested with a smart home interface connected to the program output, which would be a valid command that is interpreted from the sign language input.  The system will act as a means of processing hand sign communication for the potential use by individuals with hearing impairments or other disabilities that require visual communication devices for interacting with technology. The actualization of this product will provide a way for more people to intuitively access technology that was previously diffcult, or impossible, to use. The primary goal of the sign language interpretation system is to bridge those gaps.
